            <p>Felix Gonzalez-Torres has created nineteen candy pieces that were featured in many museums around the world. Many of his works target HIV, a topic of a serious nature, one that is still unfortunately often taboo in mainstream society. It takes the topic from the shadows, where individuals still cringe, avert their eyes, and lays it on the table for discussion and contemplation.

            <p>While there has been much development and change since the 1980s and 1990s, there has been no cure and there has remained a stigma attached to the disease. Treatment allows individuals with HIV to live long and fairly normal lives. However, much more work is still needed in the area, and there is a need for unstigmatized conversation.
            His works say so much and are absolutely just as important today as in the 1990s. If you ever have the chance, these pieces are a must to see.</p>
